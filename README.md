# Computer vision python lessons

An introduction to topics used commonly within computer vision, including examples of feature detection and matching using opencv in python, clustering, bag of words, parallel computation using pyspark and numba.

Note training a hieratical tree from the clustering algorithm implemented in python was too slow and a new repository "binary-feature-trees" has been created in C++, the idea now will be to port the key concepts from this example repository to a C++ library for performance reasons.

As of Feb 2022 this project is abandoned until I have more spare time, project published as is without finishing it.
